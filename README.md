APIs of different NLP models and methods updated to latest python version.

## About the project

This project started from the work of @inejc at https://github.com/inejc/paragraph-vectors. The original project was written in Python 2.7 and I updated it to Python 3.10. Paragraph-vectors was the starting point of this project, and the plan is to explore different NLP models.
